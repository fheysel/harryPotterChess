# Harry-Potter-inspired-voice-activated-chess

This project was inspired by Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. At the end of the book, the three
heroes must save the day by completing a series of dangerous tasks, one of which is winning a violent
game of wizard chess. In the Harry Potter series, wizard chess is played exactly like the traditional game,
with the exception that, when instructed, the pieces come alive and move on their own. The goal of the
group’s project is to build a voice-controlled chess board to allow fans of the series, avid chess players
and those with limited upper-body mobility to play the game hands-free and feel as if they are in the
magical world of Harry Potter. 

The goal of the group’s project is to build a voice-controlled chess board that will move pieces
autonomously. Using a microphone, the user can activate the chess board by saying the key phrase,
“Wizard Chess”, followed by a command. The key phrase recognition uses an offline library called
Snowboy, while the command speech recognition uses the online Google speech recognition. Upon
receiving a command, the board will then use its built-in track system, which can move in both X and Y
directions, to hold a magnet to the selected piece and move it to the desired location. The machine
must be plugged into an outlet for power and connected to Wi-fi for command recognition. This project
will allow up to two people to play a full game of chess using only their voices, which creates a more
accessible and enjoyable user experience for those with disabilities or limited movement. 

The final report and final video can be found as pdf / mp4 files titled "FINALCHESS".
